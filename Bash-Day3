t1
  RETURNS 0-10 ON SEPERATE LINES BECAUSE IT IS JUST PRINTING THE RANGE OF 0-10, COULD PRINT ANYTHING YOU TELL IT
t2
  RETURNS 0-10 ON SEPERATE LINES BECAUSE IT WAS TOLD TO STOP WHEN X IS NO LONGER LESS THAN TEN
t3
  RETURNS 0-8 AS THE LOOP WAS TOLD TO TERMINATE THE LOOP ONCE X IS GREATER THAN 8
t4 RETURNS 0-10 AS X IS NEVER EQUIVALENT IN THIS EXAMPLE TO THE STRING EIGHT; THIS EXAMPLE EXISTS TO DISPLAY POTENTIAL STRING COMPARISON
